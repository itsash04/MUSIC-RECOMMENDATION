# MUSIC-RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This is a Music Recommender System that uses datasets from audioscrobbler
We have used  Spark and the collaborative filtering technique.

# *DATASET INFORMATION*
Publicly available song data from audioscrobbler, which can be found here. However, we modified the original data files so that there is a reduction in latency while the code runs. The reduced data files have been suffixed with _small.txt and contains only the information relevant to the top 50 most prolific users (highest artist play counts).
